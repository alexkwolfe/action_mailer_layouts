A plugin to enable layouts for ActionMailer templates.

Adds a new 'layout' property to the ActionMailer::Base class. Specify the name
of the layout you want to use. The plugin will look in app/views/layouts for your 
layout.  If no layout is specified, the plugin will look for a layout that matches
the name of your mailer class.

For example:

If your mailer class is called UserNotifier and you are rendering the activation.rhtml
template, then the plugin will attempt to load the user_notifier.rhtml.  If you are 
rendering the activation.text.html.rhtml template, the plugin will look for the
user_notifier.text.html.rhtml template.

You can overload this behavior by setting the layout property of your mailer:

class UserNotfier < ActionMailer::Base
  def activation(user)
    @recipients     = user.email
    @from           = 'you@domain.com'
    @sent_on        = Time.now
    @subject		= 'Activate your account!'
    @layout         = :email
  end
end

This arrangement will cause the plugin to render the content in activation.text.html.rhtml
in the email.text.html.rhtml layout.
